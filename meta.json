    "description": "This mod offers a new take on Balatro's ante scaling. The game is extended to last for 16 Antes instead of 8, with Finisher Blinds every 4 antes and more gradual scaling. For additional challenge, the Survival+ mode starts you off with 2 less Joker slots, gaining an additional slot each time a Finisher Blind is defeated.",
