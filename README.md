# Survival Mode
This mod adds two new game modes: Survival and Survival+. In both modes, the game is extended to last for 16 Antes, with final Boss Blinds every 4 Antes. Ante scaling from Ante 9 to Ante 16 have been adjusted by varying amounts depending on stake. On Survival+ mode, you start with 2 less joker slots, but gain an additional joker slot after defeating a final Boss Blind.

# Disclaimer
For base difficulty, the chip values for Antes 9 to 16 are taken directly from the Summer 2023 playtest. Higher stakes scale significantly faster, these values are mostly eyeballed by me. Please provide feedback so I can adjust the difficulty curve as necessary in the future.
